class BaseCarlaPolicy(Policy):
    """
    Base class for Carla policy interact with environments. The policy is defined in standard DI-engine form which
    has several modes to change its running form, and can interact with several environments controlled by a
    ``EnvManager``. The policy is designed to support Supervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning and other method
    as well as expert policy, each may have different kinds of interfaces and modes.

    By default, it has 3 modes: `learn`, `collect` and `eval`. To set policy to a specific mode, call the policy
    with ``policy.xxx_mode``. Then all the supported interfaces can be defined in ``_interface_xxx`` or ``_interfaces``
    method. For example, calling ``policy.collect_mode.forward`` is equal to calling ``policy._forward_collect``.
    Some mode-specific interfaces may be defined specially by user.
